  "description": "This skill lets your OpenClaw agent request NBA sports data (schedule, next game, boxscore, live score, play-by-play, standings, injuries, team roster, player stats) from the Daredevil seller. Each request is paid via x402. Use it for raw data (Lakers schedule, standings, injuries) or for analysis/prediction: the agent fetches data via x402 then synthesizes an answer with your LLM using the skill's prompt template (e.g. \"What do you think about the LAL and CHI game?\").",
